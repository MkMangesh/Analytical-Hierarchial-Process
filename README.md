# Analytical-Hierarchial-Process Evaluator

## Problem Statement:

The 'In-General' methodology for assignment of a contract (usually by a Government body ) for any project (say construction, services) is using the lowest-bidding technique. The contractor who bids the lowest amount above some cap is usually preferred for the final approval. This may lead to biased or incorrect selection of a contractor, which may pose the risk of bad quality of final product delivered.  

The Analytical Hierarchy Process was developed by Thomas M. Saaty. This is a **Decision Making Model** that takes in range of inputs namely : Criteria and Alternatives. By using some mathematical calculations a prority vector is calculated for the Alternatives on the basis of criterias. This in return gives us a final most optimal Alternative to be selected.

## Using the Application




Its a Open source Project on Analytical-Hierarchial-Process of Contract Assignment 

The AHP Evaluator is an open source and free to use application **that** helps the user to apply the process of AHP using a user-friendly and easy to use experience. This application requires the ratings for Criteria and Alternatives from the user and gives the final Alternative as a output. 

Workflow of the Application:
Navigate to the Home Tab and Click “Get Started Button”:

Enter the Criterias and Alternatives that are to be considered:

Enter the Scores for the Criterias. Each criteria is getting compared with every other criteria here.

Head to the Alternatives Tab and similarly assign the scores for each Alternative considering each Criteria
